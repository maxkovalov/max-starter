## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Run Locally Using Docker

Ensure you have the latest version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed. You can download it [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Once it's installed, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate
```

**Important**: If you have an app running on port 3000, you'll need to stop it before running the above command. Otherwise, you'll get an error saying that port 3000 is already in use.
